# Evaluation of Logistic Regression Performance in Multi-Class Classification

## Purpose:

The purpose of this project is to apply and compare Logistic Regression in a multi-class classification problem, implement and compare Softmax Regression and One-vs-One (OvO), One-vs-Rest (OvR) strategies and model performance using Different evaluation criteria.

## Dataset:
For this project, we use the Car Evaluation dataset available in the UCI repository:

https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/19/car+evaluation

This dataset contains information about Cars, their prices and factors related to their technical characteristics.

# Project tasks:

* ### Data preprocessing:

Load and preprocess data. This includes handling missing values, normalizing/standardizing features, and dividing the dataset into training and testing sets (eg, 80% and 20% ratio).

* ### Select features:
  
Use statistical analysis to determine the variables that have the greatest impact on car acceptability.

* ### Model training with Logistic Regression and Softmax Regression:
  
• Implement logistic regression using OvR and OvO strategies for multiclass classification.

• Also implement Softmax Regression as a stand-alone model to predict multiclass classification directly.

• Train each model on the training set.

• Also implement Feature Engineering and Hyperparameter Tuning 

* ### Model evaluation:

Evaluate each model on the test set using the following criteria:

• Accuracy

• Precision

• Recall

• F1-score

Also, calculate and interpret the Confusion Matrix for each strategy.
